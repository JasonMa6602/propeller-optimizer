🚀 Excited to share my latest open-source project: Propeller Optimizer!

As a marine engineer, I was frustrated with the time it takes to run CFD simulations for preliminary propeller design. So I built a tool that does it in minutes instead of weeks.

Key features:
✅ Savitsky formula for speed prediction
✅ Gawn-Burrill series optimization
✅ Automated parameter calculations
✅ CSV-based decision rules
✅ 28% efficiency improvements

Perfect for:
🔹 Preliminary design phases
🔹 Marine engineering students
🔹 Boat builders evaluating options
🔹 Quick "what-if" scenarios

It's free, open-source, and ready to use!

GitHub: https://github.com/JasonMa6602/propeller-optimizer

Would love your feedback! 💙

Title: [Project] I built a free tool to optimize boat propellers in minutes

Body:
Hey r/engineering! I wanted to share a project I've been working on.

**Problem:** Traditional CFD-based propeller design takes weeks and expensive software.

**Solution:** I created an open-source Python tool using empirical formulas (Savitsky, Gawn-Burrill) that optimizes propeller designs in minutes.

**Use case:** I optimized a 58-knot patrol boat propeller and achieved 28% efficiency improvement through systematic iteration.

**Features:**
- Speed prediction
- Diameter sizing
- P/D ratio optimization
- KT/KQ/efficiency calculations
- No expensive software needed

**Who it's for:**
- Preliminary design phases
- Students learning propeller design
- Small boat builders
- Quick feasibility studies

It's completely free and open-source.

GitHub: https://github.com/JasonMa6602/propeller-optimizer

I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!

**Note:** This is for preliminary design only - always consult professionals for final designs.
