## 🎯 What You Need:
1. Your GitHub account (JasonMa6602) - **Already have it!** ✅
2. A web browser
3. 5 minutes of your time

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### STEP 1: Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
3. You'll see a form. Fill it in:
   - **Repository name**: Type `propeller-optimizer`
   - **Description**: Type `Propeller design tool for high-speed vessels`
   - **Public or Private**: Choose **Public** (so anyone can see it)
   - ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
4. Click the green **"Create repository"** button at the bottom

### STEP 2: You'll See a New Page
After clicking "Create repository", GitHub will show you a page with commands.
**Don't worry about those commands!** We'll use a simpler way.

### STEP 3: Upload Files the Easy Way
On that same page, look for this text:
"**...or push an existing repository from the command line**"

Above it, you should see a link that says:
"**uploading an existing file**"

Click on that link!

### STEP 4: Upload Your Files
Now you have 2 options:

#### Option A: Upload Individual Files (Recommended)
1. Click "**Add file**" button (top right)
2. Choose "**Upload files**"
3. Open your file manager and go to: `/home/admin123/propeller-optimizer/`
4. Select ALL files and folders inside
5. Drag them into the GitHub upload area
6. Scroll down and click "**Commit changes**"

#### Option B: Extract and Upload (If Option A doesn't work)
1. Right-click on `/home/admin123/propeller-optimizer.tar.gz`
2. Choose "Extract here"
3. Then follow Option A steps above
